# Mule Vault Connector CRUD Demo
This demo exposes 5 listeners to demonstrate the operations available in the Vault Connector. 
The connector allows for secrets to be retrieved and written. It also allows one to encrypt, decrypt, and reencrypt data
 using the Transit secrets engine.

* /getSecret
* /writeSecret
* /encrypt
* /decrypt
* /reencrypt



# Executing the Vault Connector Demo

## Step 0: Install prerequisites

You will need Vault locally and on your PATH

## Step 1: Start Vault

Execute setupDemo.sh to kill any previously running Vault server instances and start a new instance. 

It will add a new secret at secrets/stamples/sample1, enable the transit secret engine, and create a key called demo-key

## Step 2: Execute the Demo application

Open the demo application (vault-connector-demo) with Anypoint Studio and start the application as a Mule Application

### Executing get-secret-flow

Execute the following to test the Get Secret component

`curl -d '{"path":"secret/samples/sample1"}' -X POST http://localhost:8081/getSecret`

### Executing write-secret-flow

Execute the following to test the Write Secret component

`curl -d '{"path":"secret/samples/sample2","secret":"{\"attr1\":\"data2\"}"}' -X POST http://localhost:8081/writeSecret`
 
`curl -d '{"path":"secret/samples/sample2"}' -X POST http://localhost:8081/getSecret`

### Executing encrypt-data-flow

Execute the following to test the Encrypt data component

`curl -d '{"plaintext":"This is my sample plaintext"}' -X POST http://localhost:8081/encrypt`

### Executing decrypt-data-flow

Execute the following to test the Decrypt data component, replacing CIPHERTEXT with the output of the command above

`curl -d '{"ciphertext":"CIPHERTEXT"}' -X POST http://localhost:8081/decrypt`

### Executing reencrypt-data-flow

Execute the following to test the Reencrypt data component, replacing CIPHERTEXT with the output of the command above

`curl -d '{"ciphertext":"CIPHERTEXT"}' -X POST http://localhost:8081/reencrypt`

## Step 3: Stopping Vault

Execute `killVault.sh` to kill all running Vault servers
